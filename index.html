    <h1>COMING SOON TO BRIXTON</h1>

    <p class="one">Curfew was created in 2020. Created because of 2020. A company born right when our world stopped – amongst a Global lockdown. During worldwide protests. Mandatory quarantine, and heightened civil obedience laws. Amidst a time of modern chaos.</p>
    <p class="two">Curfew represents a raging fire in the belly of the people who want change. A rebellious energy, amongst a world that has lost its way. </p>
    <p class="three">Curfew is a fire that will never be put out…</p>
    <p class="four">…even if it means breaking the rules.</p>
